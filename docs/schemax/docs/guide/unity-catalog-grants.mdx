# Unity Catalog Grants

SchemaX lets you manage **Unity Catalog grants** (privileges) on catalogs, schemas, tables, and views from the designer and via the CLI. Grants are stored in your schema state and emitted as `GRANT` / `REVOKE` statements when you generate SQL or run `schemax apply`.

---

## Where you can manage grants

| Securable | Where in SchemaX |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Catalog** | Select a catalog in the tree → detail panel → **Grants** section |
| **Schema** | Select a schema in the tree → detail panel → **Grants** section |
| **Table** | Select a table → **Security & Governance** (or table detail) → **Grants** section |
| **View** | Select a view → detail panel → **Grants** section |

Add or remove grants per principal (user, group, or service principal). Each grant has a **principal** and a list of **privileges**.

## Supported privileges by object type

### Catalog-level privileges

- ALL PRIVILEGES  
- USE CATALOG  
- USE SCHEMA  
- CREATE SCHEMA  
- CREATE TABLE  
- CREATE VIEW  
- CREATE FUNCTION  
- CREATE VOLUME  
- CREATE EXTERNAL LOCATION  
- CREATE STORAGE CREDENTIAL  
- CREATE CONNECTION  
- CREATE SHARING  
- CREATE RECIPIENT  
- CREATE PROVIDER  
- CREATE CATALOG  
- CREATE MODEL  
- CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW  
- CREATE PIPELINE  
- EXECUTE  
- MODIFY  
- SELECT  
- READ VOLUME  
- WRITE VOLUME  
- APPLY TAG  
- USE MARKETPLACE ASSETS  

### Schema-level privileges

- ALL PRIVILEGES  
- USE SCHEMA  
- CREATE TABLE  
- CREATE VIEW  
- CREATE FUNCTION  
- CREATE VOLUME  
- CREATE MODEL  
- CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW  
- CREATE PIPELINE  
- EXECUTE  
- MODIFY  
- SELECT  
- READ VOLUME  
- WRITE VOLUME  
- APPLY TAG  

### Table- and view-level privileges

- ALL PRIVILEGES  
- SELECT  
- MODIFY  
- READ VOLUME  
- WRITE VOLUME  
- APPLY TAG  

These align with [Databricks SQL privileges](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-privileges.html) for Unity Catalog.

---

## Principals

Grants are assigned to **principals**:

- **Users** — e.g. `user@example.com`
- **Groups** — e.g. `data_engineers`, `analysts`
- **Service principals** — e.g. `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012`

Use the same principal names and formats that Unity Catalog expects (see [Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-principals.html)).

---

## In the VS Code designer

1. Select a **catalog**, **schema**, **table**, or **view** in the tree.
2. Open the **Grants** section in the detail panel (catalog/schema) or in **Security & Governance** (table/view).
3. **Add grant:** Click **Add grant**, enter the principal (e.g. group name or email), and choose one or more privileges.
4. **Revoke:** Remove a grant or uncheck privileges; SchemaX will emit the appropriate `REVOKE` when you generate SQL or apply.
5. **Generate SQL** or **Apply** — grants are included in the generated DDL and in `schemax apply` when the **Governance** managed category is enabled for that environment.

---

## CLI and SQL generation

- **Generate SQL:** `schemax sql --target ENV` (or VS Code **Generate SQL Migration** with an environment selected) includes `GRANT` and `REVOKE` statements for grant operations in the changelog or diff.
- **Apply:** `schemax apply --target ENV` runs those statements against the target. Grant operations are part of **governance**; they are included when the environment’s [deployment scope](/guide/environments-and-scope) includes **Governance** (default: all categories).
- **Rollback:** Grant changes are treated as safe; partial and complete rollback can revert grant operations where applicable.

---

## Example generated SQL

```sql
-- Grant on catalog
GRANT USE CATALOG, CREATE SCHEMA ON CATALOG `my_catalog` TO `data_engineers`;

-- Grant on schema
GRANT USE SCHEMA, CREATE TABLE ON SCHEMA `my_catalog`.`my_schema` TO `analysts`;

-- Grant on table
GRANT SELECT, MODIFY ON TABLE `my_catalog`.`my_schema`.`my_table` TO `bi_users`;
```

## Best practices

- **Version grants with schema:** Keep grants in SchemaX state and create snapshots so grant changes are reviewed and deployed with the rest of the schema.
- **Use groups:** Prefer group principals (e.g. `data_engineers`, `analysts`) over individual users so membership is managed in your identity provider.
- **Governance-only deployments:** If you only want to push grant (and other governance) changes without structural DDL, use [Environments and deployment scope](/guide/environments-and-scope) and set **Governance** as the only managed category for that environment.
- **Existing catalogs:** When catalogs already exist and you use [existing objects](/guide/environments-and-scope#existing-catalogs), SchemaX still emits grants for those catalogs (and their schemas/tables/views) as long as Governance is in scope.

For rollback and deployment workflows, see [Workflows](/reference/workflows).
