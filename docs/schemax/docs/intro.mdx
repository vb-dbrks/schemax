# SchemaX

SchemaX is a **modern, low-touch, interactive schema migration and management tool** for data catalogs. It's **Git- and CI/CD-friendly**: you design schemas in the VS Code designer or define them in code, store changes as versioned operations and snapshots, and generate or apply SQL per environment. Use it in **full mode** (create and manage catalogs, schemas, tables, and governance) or **governance-only mode** (comments, tags, grants, row filters, column masks on existing objects). Unity Catalog is supported today; Hive and PostgreSQL are planned.

:::tip Choose your path
**New here?** Start with [Prerequisites](guide/prerequisites) and [Quickstart](guide/quickstart).  
**Only need CI/CD?** Go to [Git and CI/CD setup](guide/git-and-cicd-setup) to run SchemaX in Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions (non-interactive).

:::info Distribution
SchemaX is **open source** (not a Databricks Labs project). When published:
- **Python SDK & CLI** → [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/schemaxpy/) (`pip install schemaxpy`)
- **VS Code extension** → [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) (search "SchemaX")
Until then, install from source (see [Quickstart](guide/quickstart) and [Development](guide/development)).

## What is schema management and migration?

- **Schema management** is defining and maintaining the structure of your data catalog—catalogs, schemas, tables, views, and their metadata (columns, types, comments, constraints). In Unity Catalog this is the layer that decides *what* exists and *who* can access it.
- **Schema migration** is applying changes to that structure over time in a controlled way (e.g. add a column, add a table, change grants) and tracking those changes so they can be reviewed, versioned, and deployed per environment (dev → test → prod).
- Without it, schema changes are ad hoc, hard to audit, and risky when promoting to production. With it, changes are declarative, in Git, and applied consistently via CI/CD or manual apply.

## When to use SchemaX

- **Full creation and management** — Greenfield or brownfield projects where you want to design and deploy catalogs, schemas, tables, and governance from one place. Classic "schema as code" with visual design and SQL generation.
- **Spark / Delta Live Tables** — If tables and schemas are created by Spark or DLT, **creation** may be less relevant for SchemaX. **Governance** is still valuable: comments, tags, grants, row filters, column masks on those existing objects. Use SchemaX in **governance-only mode** so you version and deploy only governance DDL, not CREATE TABLE.
- **Databricks Apps and Lakebase** — When building applications on the Databricks platform (e.g. Databricks Apps with Streamlit, Dash, or apps that combine Lakebase with the lakehouse), the **Unity Catalog** layer—catalogs, schemas, tables, and governance (grants, tags, row filters)—still needs to be consistent across environments and versioned. SchemaX manages that UC layer (full or governance-only) and fits into Git and CI/CD so app deployments and schema deployments stay aligned. (SchemaX manages Unity Catalog; Lakebase's own Postgres schema is separate.)

See [Environments and deployment scope](guide/environments-and-scope) for **full mode vs governance-only** and how to scope deployments to existing objects.

## Features

- Snapshot-based versioning with semantic versions
- Real-time SQL generation

### Python SDK & CLI

- Command-line tools for automation and CI/CD
- Python API for custom workflows
- Deployment tracking with database-backed audit trail
- Automatic and manual rollback
- Snapshot lifecycle: create, validate, rebase
- Schema validation and circular dependency detection
