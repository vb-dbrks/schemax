# Testing Guide

## Overview

- **Python SDK**: pytest (300+ tests), coverage, SQLGlot validation.
- **VS Code Extension**: Jest + React Testing Library.
- **Integration**: End-to-end workflow tests (see [Workflows](/reference/workflows)).

## Python SDK

### Run tests

```bash
cd packages/python-sdk
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/ -q
pytest tests/ -v
pytest tests/unit/test_sql_generator.py -v
pytest tests/ --cov=src/schematic --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Structure

- `tests/unit/` — Storage, SQL generator, state reducer, differ, catalog mapping, executor, rollback, apply.
- `tests/integration/` — Workflows, command workflows, workflow e2e (WORKFLOWS.md situations), view dependencies.

### Before committing

Run `./devops/run-checks.sh` (format, lint, pytest, smoke).

## Workflow E2E tests

`tests/integration/test_workflows_e2e.py` covers all five situations in [Workflows](/reference/workflows): greenfield single/multi-dev, brownfield (import, baseline, rollback guard), apply failure and rollback, diff/validate/SQL-only.

```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_workflows_e2e.py -v
```
