# Schematic Workflows & Data Project Lifecycle

Schematic fits in the **schema layer** of data projects: it version-controls and deploys catalogs, schemas, tables, views, constraints, row filters, and column masks so that:

- Changes are declarative, reviewed in Git, and applied in order (dev → test → prod).
- Rollback and diff are possible when something goes wrong or when comparing environments.
- Existing catalogs can be **imported** and then managed going forward.

## Five situations

| Situation | Summary | Key commands |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **1. Greenfield single dev** | New project; one developer. | Init → Ops → Snapshot → Apply (dev → test → prod). |
| **2. Greenfield multi-dev** | Same project; branches, merge, rebase. | Validate after merge; `schematic snapshot validate`; `schematic snapshot rebase &lt;version&gt;`. |
| **3. Brownfield** | Catalog already exists in Databricks. | `schematic import --target dev --catalog NAME`; optional `--adopt-baseline`; then same as greenfield. |
| **4. Apply failure and rollback** | One statement fails during apply. | Partial: `schematic rollback --deployment &lt;id&gt; --partial`. Complete: `schematic rollback --to-snapshot v0.1.0`. |
| **5. Diff, validate, SQL-only** | No live DB needed. | `schematic diff`, `schematic validate`, `schematic sql --output migration.sql`. |

## Rollback before baseline (brownfield)

After **import with adopt-baseline**, the imported snapshot is the deployment baseline for that environment. Rolling back to a snapshot **older than** that baseline is **blocked by default**; use `--force` (and confirmation) to override.
