# Setup

Get the SchemaX extension and CLI installed and open a project. For a full walkthrough, see [Quickstart](/guide/quickstart/).

## 1. Install the VS Code extension

**From source (development):**

1. Clone the repo and open it in VS Code: `code /path/to/schemax-vscode`
2. Press **F5** to launch the Extension Development Host (builds and loads the extension in a new window).

**When published:** Install "SchemaX" from the VS Code Marketplace (search "SchemaX" in Extensions).

## 2. Install the CLI (Python SDK)

The CLI is required for `schemax apply`, `schemax validate`, `schemax sql`, snapshots, and CI/CD.

**From source:**

```bash
cd packages/python-sdk
pip install -e .
# or: uv pip install -e .
```

**When published:**

```bash
pip install schemaxpy
# or: uv pip install schemaxpy
```

Verify:

```bash
schemax --help
```

## 3. Open a project

1. In VS Code (or Extension Development Host), **File → Open Folder**
2. Choose a folder that will hold your SchemaX project (e.g. a Git repo or new directory).

## 4. First-time project init

- If the folder has no `.schemax/` directory, opening the designer (**SchemaX: Open Designer**) will create a new SchemaX project (Unity Catalog by default) with a default environment and empty state.
- If the folder already has `.schemax/project.json`, SchemaX loads that project.
