# Prerequisites

Before you start with SchemaX, ensure you have the following.

## For using the VS Code extension

- **VS Code** — A recent version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or Cursor / VS Codium). The extension is developed and tested on current stable releases.
- **Workspace** — A folder opened in VS Code that will hold (or already holds) your SchemaX project (e.g. a repo with or without an existing `.schematic/` directory).

## For using the CLI (apply, validate, SQL, snapshots)

- **Python** — Python 3.9 or newer. The SchemaX CLI and SDK are Python-based.
- **Optional: uv** — [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) can be used for faster installs and virtual environments; standard `pip` works as well.

## For building the extension from source (contributors)

- **Node.js and npm** — Required to build the VS Code extension and webview. Use a current LTS version.

## For Databricks Unity Catalog

- **Databricks workspace** — Access to a workspace with Unity Catalog enabled.
- **Permissions** — For **apply** and **import**, the identity (user or service principal) must have privileges to create and alter catalogs, schemas, and tables (and to manage grants, row filters, column masks if you use those). For **read-only** use (designer, `schemax sql`, `schemax validate`), workspace access and project file access are enough.
