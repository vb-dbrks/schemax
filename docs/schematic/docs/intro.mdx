# Schematic

**Open source · Multi-provider data catalog schema management with version control.**

Schematic is an extensible toolkit for managing data catalog schemas (Unity Catalog, Hive Metastore, PostgreSQL) using a declarative, version-controlled approach. Design schemas visually in VS Code or manage them programmatically with Python, then generate SQL migrations for deployment.

:::info Distribution
Schematic is **open source** (not a Databricks Labs project). When published:
- **Python SDK & CLI** → [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/schematic-py/) (`pip install schematic-py`)
- **VS Code extension** → [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) (search "Schematic")
Until then, install from source (see [Quickstart](guide/quickstart) and [Development](guide/development)).

- Real-time SQL generation

### Python SDK & CLI

- Command-line tools for automation and CI/CD
